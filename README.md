#Laravel-app

This project is a modest recriation of applications like twitter and reddit, it is a simple social media that allows you to create an account using validation, then you have the posibility to create posts, follow friends, see their posts and manage your avatar also the aplication has a chat feature.

In this project I used many diffrent features like mailTrap for sending emails to the user when he creates a post, Pusher for chat broadcasting. Also while creating this project I learned many new things and understood better concepts like Gates, Policies, Permissions, Models query, API URLS, Docker for a fake deploying to a linux server, user registration, log in and log out and of course PHP language itself.

Some of the challanges i faced was implementing the chat feature and the search bar because they required implementing code from JavaScript and some of the new services that i was not familiar before like pusher. 

In the future I would like to work on the frontend part of the project and make it more good looking for the eyes.
