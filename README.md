#Laravel-app

This project is a modest recreation of applications like Twitter and Reddit. It is a simple social media platform that allows you to create an account using validation. Once registered, you have the possibility to create posts, follow friends, see their posts, manage your avatar, and utilize the chat feature.

Throughout this project, I implemented various features, such as using Mailtrap for sending emails to users when they create a post and Pusher for chat broadcasting. Additionally, I learned many new concepts, including Gates, Policies, Permissions, Model queries, API URLs, Docker for simulated deployment to a Linux server, user registration, login, logout, and of course, PHP language itself.

Some of the challenges I encountered included implementing the chat feature and the search bar, as they required integrating JavaScript code and using new services like Pusher, which I wasn't familiar with before.

In the future, I plan to focus on enhancing the frontend part of the project to improve its visual appeal.
